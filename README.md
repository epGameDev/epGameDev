# Eric Philippot

I am a self taught game and web developer. Started back in 2016 with game development learning the basics, then in 2019 I started to tinker in web development. 

- I love to play with the raspberryi pi SBC and build servers. I also love spending time outdoors, going for hikes or staring out the window like a cat. 
- I am currently learning Shopify Liquid,but before that I have done basic frontend web development, NodeJS, MongoDB and Astro. I have dabbled a bit in React, Wordpress, SQL and C# (outside of Unity), but not enough to say I have working knowledge on the matter. 
- Projects I am most interested in are server-side, multi-media, games, robotics, e-commerce and education applications.
