- Hi, my name is Eric Philippot and I am an aspiring web developer.
- I love to tinker with raspberyi pi and build video games. I also love the outdoors and taking long hikes.
- I am currently learning JavaScript after comming off of some C#. I plan to learn backend soon but have much more exploring to do.
- Projects I am most interested in are in multi-media, robotics and education applications.
