- Hi, my name is Eric Philippot and I am an aspiring web developer.
- I love to tinker with raspberryi pi and build video games. I also love the outdoors and taking long hikes.
- I am currently learning the MERN getting back into some C# using Unity.
- Projects I am most interested in are in multi-media, games, robotics and education applications.
