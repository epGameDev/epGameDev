# Hi, my name is Eric Philippot

I am a self taught game and web developer. Started back in 2016 with game development learning the basics, then in 2019 I started to tinker in web development. 

- I love to tinker with raspberryi pi and build servers. I also love the outdoors and taking long hikes.
- I am currently learning Shopify Liquid but before that I have played around with basic frontend development, NodeJS, MongoDB and Astro.
- Projects I am most interested in are server-side, multi-media, games, robotics and education applications.
